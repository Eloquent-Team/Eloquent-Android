The App makes use of the [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) architecture pattern by delegating the business logic of the UI to a Viewmodel which requests data from a reposity. The repository gets the raw data from one or multiple Datasources, in this application from a [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5KquzdiS6QIVkkTTCh1sDwroEAAYASAAEgIwyfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) Database.
