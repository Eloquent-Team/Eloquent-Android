# Eloquent-Android
_Repository for our Android App - Written in Kotlin_

Eloquent is a coaching app that uses AI to analyze voice. It offers immediate feedback and suggestions on how to improve verbal skills. Speakers can use the app for training specific elements such as articulacy, intensity, and melody to ensure that they become the speakers they inspire to be.

## Setup Instructions
To run the Eloquent Android app on your Android smartphone, clone this repository and open it with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

When Android Studio is open, you can click on the green play button in the top right corner of the window.
You may have to make some additional setup on your phone if this is your first time running an Android app on your phone. You can get help [here](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app).


## Documentation

The App makes use of the [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) architecture pattern by delegating the business logic of the UI to a Viewmodel which requests data from a repository. The repository gets the raw data from one or multiple datasources, in this application from a [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5KquzdiS6QIVkkTTCh1sDwroEAAYASAAEgIwyfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) database.

We incorporated [Dagger2](https://dagger.dev/) to reuse boilerplate code and make usage of factories and dependency injection. With this library our codebase shrinks to a minimal and makes it clean.

To record the voice of our user, we ask for permissions(Microphone and Storage) first. The library is called _MediaRecorder_ and built in to Android. We save these recording on the internal storage of the phone and save the reference in our Room database.

The application is thoroughly tested leveraging [Dagger2](https://dagger.dev/), [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) and [Robolectric](http://robolectric.org/).
